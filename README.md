This is a Hugo theme for my personal website.
Most of the shortcodes are taken from [loikein/hugo-tufte](https://github.com/loikein/hugo-tufte/tree/main) (which currently doesn't compile for me, I've forked it [here](https://github.com/axolotls73/hugo-tufte)), which adapts the [Tufte CSS](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css) project.
